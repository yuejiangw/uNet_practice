# uNet_practice

This small and simple project is my own practice of using Unet model to achieve medical semantic segmentation. 

The dataset comes from an ISBI challange, which is also included in the repository. So there's no need to worry about it.

The source code referenced other people's blogs, and I will try my best to give detailed annotation of the codes to make sure that a novice can understand the codes easily.

It is not easy to learn deep learning through self-study. I hope my code will help you on your way to AI.
